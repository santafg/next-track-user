# Next.js User Tracker Application with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript

This project is a user tracker application built with Next.js, React js, styled using Tailwind CSS, and handles API calls using TanStack Query. Here's an overview of the structure and main features:

## Folder Structure & Organization

### API Handling:
- **axios instance**: Manages API requests and error handling.
- **endpoints**: Contains the defined API routes.
- **functions**: Holds the logic for API interactions.

### Components:
- **Layout**: General layout of the app.
- **Navbar**: Navigation bar component.
- **Wrapper**: Additional wrappers, including tracking providers.

### TypeScript Interfaces:
- A dedicated folder for storing all TypeScript interfaces and types for easy reference.

### Lib Folder:
- **Hooks**: A custom hook named `useTrackEvents` is created for event tracking.
- **Utils**: Contains utility functions such as device info retrieval.

## Tracking Features

### TrackingProvider Component:
- Found in the **Wrapper** folder.
- Wraps the app through `app.tsx` and tracks events like page visits and redirections.

### Event Tracking:
- For tracking user interactions (clicks on components, buttons, or links), use the `useTrackEvents` hook.
- Simply pass the event name to track any specific action.

## API Endpoint for Event Tracking
A simple POST API is created using Next.js to receive tracking events through the `useTrackEvents` hook.  
The tracking data is sent in a structured format, and the API returns a response with a message: **"Track successful"**.

## Front-End Error Handling
When clicking on the links of the navbar, the visit page event wonâ€™t trigger since the user is on the same page. However, if the page is reloaded or visited initially, the event is recorded once.
